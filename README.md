# Engine
WIP 3D Boxel rendering/input engine. No, it's not a Minecraft clone, you can put any game on it,
it's just rendering and user-inputs detection.

Don't use it. The debug phase has not even started. Seriously, don't. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.
The Lua sources are just here for testing only. Also, it won't have mods. It was just a test.

### License

* Don't use it.
